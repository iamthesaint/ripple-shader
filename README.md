## *Tech Stack* 

- **Three.js** — WebGL renderer for visual effects
- **Custom GLSL Shaders** — Ripple/water effects using render-to-texture and fragment shaders
- **GSAP + ScrollTrigger** — Scroll-based effects, smooth transitions, and sound control
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — Clean framework, functional programming
- **HTML & CSS** — Responsive layout and animation, custom text effects
- **Audio Integration** — Ethereal sounds and UI sfx (desktop only)

## *Features*

- Overlay screen to initiate audio
- Custom ripple shader responsive to cursor as constant background
- Smooth scroll transitions between sections
- Sound FX - on hover, click, and ambient background with mute option
- Mobile optimization in progress

## *Inspiration*

Visual style draws from interactive, moody storytelling using glitch art and ambient sound design -
Individual elements are inspired by game theory and nature - specifically textural elements
